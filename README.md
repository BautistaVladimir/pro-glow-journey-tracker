 5.PossibleCha
 lengesMayEncounter
UserDataInputAccuracy: Relying on manual user input for tracking can lead to inaccuracies
 or inconsistencies in the data.
 SubjectivityinLogging: Estimating portion sizes for food and intensity levels for workouts can
 besubjective and vary between users.
 MaintainingUserEngage
 ment: Keeping users consistently logging their data and actively
 using the system can beachalenge.
 DataInterpretationandProviding
 Meaningful Insights: The current scope focuses on basic
 visualization. Providing truly insightful and actionable feedback based on the limited data
 could bechalenging.
 ScalabilityandPerfor
 mance: As theuser basegrows andmoredatais accumulated, ensuring
 the system remains scalable and performs efficiently wi l be crucial.
 DataSecurityandPrivacy: Handling user health and fitness data requires robust security
 measures andadherencetoprivacy regulations.
 FeaturePrioritizationandDevelop
 ment: Deciding on which features to implement next and
 managing thedevelopment process effectively can be chalenging.
 Potential for
 MisinterpretationofB
 MI: Users may solely focus on BMI without considering
 other important health indicators, leading to a potentia ly incomplete understanding of their
